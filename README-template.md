## My process

I started by adding my style.css link, after which I included my [div class main], followed by the [div class card] in which my QR Scan and QR Text is nested within, with the [div class [qr-code and qr-code-text]], and lastly, I added my name and my LinkedIn profile link to the [div class attribution], after which I moved on to calling and styling my class selectors each, using an external CSS file, except for the class [attribution] which has been styled already, within the HTML file. The CSS was a little challenging at first when I was having a hard time centering the contents, but then I decided to start over, and I was able to solve the problem. It was fun and challenging, and I'll be delighted to solve more complex challenges moving forward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was introduced to the use of attributes, and also i i included padding to my media quary selector.

```html
<div class="attribution"></div>
```

```css
.card {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

while on the project, I realized that my CSS needs more inprovement and this area will be part of my focuse untill I'm atmost profectional.
